In this project, I have picked the New York City Airbnb dataset from kaggle. The dataset contains 48k+ Airbnd listings, hosts and other metrics using which I have solved some questions to get insights on the data. 

For more information about the dataset and to download the dateset, please click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data).

I have used Microsoft SQL Server for the case study.
